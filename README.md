# AI-Medical-Prescription-Verification
The project aims to build an AI system to automatically verify medical prescriptions, reducing errors in drug names, dosages, and interactions. Using OCR, IBM Watson NLP, and Hugging Face models, it digitizes, analyzes, and cross-checks prescriptions, flagging risks to ensure safe, accurate, and efficient healthcare.
